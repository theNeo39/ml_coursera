# ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
# Instructions: Complete the following code to make predictions using
#               your learned logistic regression parameters (one-vs-all).
#               You should set p to a vector of predictions (from 1 to
#               num_labels).
#
# Hint: This code can be done all vectorized using the max function.
#       In particular, the max function can also return the index of the 
#       max element, for more information see 'help max'. If your examples 
#       are in rows, then, you can use max(A, [], 2) to obtain the max 
#       for each row.
#
